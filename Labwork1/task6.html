        <p id="fontsize">Humanity are exceptional (emded font size)</p>
        <p class="redtextembedded">No future is guaranteed<br>
            Even the most optimistic futures will bring deep injustices and suffering.<br>
            But to despair for our future is to ignore our history and our exceptionalism.<br>
            Our resiliency will protect us; our intelligence will propel us.<br>
            Optimism is not only justified, it's a weapon in the fight for a higher future. (embedded style font color)</p>
        <p class="redtextexternal">Only the worst-case scenarios can stop us.<br>
            If we can avoid them we have the potential to seed a vast new branch of life that could outgrow Earth itself and spread across the universe.<br>
            If there is one lesson our history can teach us, it's to never underestimate the human race.(external style dont color)</p>
